Busel Hısım , Mert İşeri, Meltem Özleşen Home Automation Project
What we will be automating: In our home automation system, we will be automating
-air conditioning
-checking whether windows and doors are open
-lights of the house 
-Checking whether small household appliances are turned on
-water heating system
-home music system consisting of a large speaker in the living room.
What we need to do is to prepare a detailed home automation system for remote control and automation of a home. We will describe each system we want to bulid in Verilog hardware description language as separate blocks, by using logic gates, block diagrams when necessary, by first writing truth tables for each step of the home automation system we plan, by using multiplexers, and by using the methods of simplifying logical expressions for complex truth tables. When we integrate these blocks together at the necessary points, we will have a large and single top module. After writing the testbench of the top module and checking whether it works correctly,we will perform synthesis and implementation
